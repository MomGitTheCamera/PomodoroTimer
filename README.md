## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://i.imgur.com/rvGOu6y.png)

This is a project I made to step into web development, it was made using the stack of HTML5, JavaScript and CSS. I intend to use the application to help with my studies! The application is currently hosted on <a href=https://kabuto-mk7.github.io/PomodoroTimer>GitHub pages</a>.

What I learned from this project:

* Developing my skills with JavaScript
* Design elements, using CSS and HTML
* Working with full stack, from design and front end to back end
* Using API's (Google Fonts)
* Learning optimization techniques for performance
* Running a always-on publication (GitHub Pages)

## Features

Here is a full list of features this app currently supports

* Play, begins a 25 minute timer.
* Break, after the 25 minute timer, a second 5 minute timer begins.
* Reset, resets the current timer back to 25 minutes.
* Custom timer (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED).
* Custom break timer (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED).
* Pause timer (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED).
* Plays sounds from provided mp3 files.

More features are on the way as this project is still a work in progress!
